===================== ABOUT THE GAME ========================

Welcome to the mysterious world of Zelda. Work Link, by driving
among the sea monsters, killing them and manouvering your sail
around the rocks to face off the monster boss to get the token
to the Island of Zelda.

Spread over a huge area, the miraculous ocean of Zelda has
numerous sea monsters of different types. Kill them with the
cannon and drive over the gifts they drop to increase your
points. Hitting a sea monster can reduce your health. Golden
monster impacts you health more adversely than the silver
monster.

Don't forget to NOT to hit the rocks. It can damage your boat,
and hence increasing the chances of your boat drowning among the
sea monsters.

The ocean of Zelda suffers from storms, they change directions
like humans change faces. Handle your boat in storms by preventing
it from hitting rocks or monsters.

There are gift barrels specially for you, to drive over and fetch
different types of diamonds which increase your points.

Once you achieve 1000 credits, you will have a face off with the
boss. The boss is an herbivore, but doesn't tolerate death of his
fellow monsters. He promises not to kill you, but if you drive
your sail into him, he swears to damage it harshly. Try not to
invoke his temper. Killing the first monster boss will drop booster.
It will increase your boat speed.

With power, comes responsibility. Increase in speed means, you can
hit rocks faster and run into sea creatures easily. Drive safe
and keep your health points tick steady. Once again, on achieving
2000 points, the mate of monster boss appears to take revenge.
It will disappear in waters and appear out in front of you.
Try not to run into her in speed. She has vowed to draw blood.
If you free her spirit, her soul will teleport you to the Lost
Island of Zelda which has a hidden gem somewhere.

Remember, bosses don't die easily and they chase you till they die.

Once, teleported... Drive your way to the shores of the island.
You now have the hunt mode available. Tune into the hunt mode
and hunt down the gem with Link. Remember, if you try testing into
hunt mode mid ocean, you will drown. Deal, as simple as it is!
Don't mock with the I KEY.

Hidden somewhere in the island between the trees or behind them.
Simple way to win the game is to move Link over the gem. Once,
Link's heart absorbs the gem, he becomes immortal and the game ends
with Link thanking you for all your help.

======================= HAPPY PLAYING =========================
